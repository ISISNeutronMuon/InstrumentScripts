Tutorial
********


  These are examples of some basic scans that the user might perform
  on the high level interface.  The examples have run on a virtual
  instrument defined in a later section. This documentation also
  serves as a testing basis to ensure that this the code always
  matches the functionality declared here.

Plot Motor Scan
---------------

  Our first, simplest example is the user plotting a scan of the
  detector intensity as the motor moves from 0 to 2 exclusively in
  steps of 0.6.

  >>> from general.scans.motion import populate
  >>> populate()
  >>> scan(theta, 0, 2, 0.6, 50)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00

  The above is the simplest possible kind of default scan.  The first
  parameter is the starting point, the second is the stopping point,
  the third is the step size, and the final parameter is the number of
  frames to measure at each point.  For most cases, it should be
  sufficient, but there are many more options that can be layered on
  top.

  >>> scan(theta, 0, 2, stride=0.6, frames=10)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00

  Above, we've not used the default ``step`` parameter, but did use
  the ``stride`` parameter instead.  Setting the ``stride`` instead of
  setting the ``step`` allow the instrument to slightly adjust the
  step size to ensure that the end point is included in the scan.  In
  this example, the step size was decrease from 0.6 mm to 0.5 mm.

  .. note:: Since we skipped the ``step`` parameter, we had to give
	    the ``frames`` parameter by name.

  The results of all scans are saved to a log file.  The location of
  the log is set by the instrument scientist.  The data from the scan
  above can be seen below.

  .. literalinclude:: mock_scan_02.dat
     :caption: mock_scan_02.dat

  .. test

     >>> infile = open("mock_scan_02.dat", "r")
     >>> lines = infile.readlines()
     >>> infile.close()
     >>> for line in lines: print(line.split("\t")[0])
     0.0
     0.5
     1.0
     1.5
     2.0

  >>> s = scan(theta, 0, 2, 0.6, seconds=1, save="plot_example.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00

  The ``save`` argument allows the figure to be saved to a file.
  Otherwise, the screen will show the plot interactively.  Also,
  notice we've given the time for each measuremnt in ``seconds``
  instead of frames.  The values or ``minutes``, ``hours``, and
  ``uamps`` are also accepted.

  .. image:: plot_example.png
     :alt: Example plot

  There are many possibilities beyond the ``start``, ``stop``,
  ``step``, and ``stride`` that have been introduced thus far.  For
  example, ``count`` and ``gaps`` allow the user to specify the number
  of measurements and the number of gaps, respectively.

  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, count=4, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.67 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.33 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, gaps=4, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00

  The user also has the option of fixing the steps size and number of
  measurements or gaps while leaving the ending position open.

  >>> scan(theta, start=0, step=0.6, count=5, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.40 and two theta=0.00
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stride=0.6, gaps=5, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=3.00 and two theta=0.00

  For when relative scans make more sense, it's possible to request
  them by replacing start and stop with ``before`` and ``after``.

  >>> scan(theta, before=-1, after=1, stride=0.6, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=3.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=3.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=4.00 and two theta=0.00

  Since relative scans are fairly common, there's a built in
  :meth:`general.scans.defaults.Defaults.rscan` method which defaults to a relative scan,
  instead of an absolute.

  >>> rscan(theta, -1, 1, 0.5, 5)
  Taking a count at theta=3.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=3.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=4.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=4.50 and two theta=0.00
  >>> theta
  Theta is at 4.0

  .. note:: Some combinations of values do not provide enough
	    information to create a scan.  A :class:`RuntimeError`
	    will be thrown if a scan cannot be constructed

	    >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=0.6, after=2)
	    Traceback (most recent call last):
	    ...
	    RuntimeError: Unable to build a scan with that set of options.

Motor Objects
-------------

  We've been using the motor object ``theta``, but we haven't
  discussed how it works.

  >>> theta()
  4.0

  Calling the object with no parameters returns the current position.
  This position can be changed by giving a new value in the function

  >>> THETA()
  4.0
  >>> Theta()
  4.0

  The axis can be called by its name in lower case, in upper case, or
  as case in the IBEX block.

  >>> theta(3.0)
  >>> theta
  Theta is at 3.0

  We can also perform some relative changes with Python's in place
  operators.

  >>> theta += 1.5
  >>> theta
  Theta is at 4.5
  >>> theta -= 4
  >>> theta *= 2
  >>> theta
  Theta is at 1.0

  Soft limits can be placed on motors with the `low` and `high`
  properties.  Scans that attempt to exceed these values will throw an
  error.

  >>> theta.low = 0
  >>> theta.high = 2
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=10, count=21)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
  RuntimeError: Position 2.5 is above upper limit 2 of motor Theta

  >>> theta.high = None

  Motor objects can also get and set the velocity of a motor:

  >>> theta.velocity = 20
  >>> theta.velocity
  20

  And find out about the tolerance of a motor:

  >>> theta.tolerance
  0

  If there is no Motion object for a specific axis, the user can give
  the name in a string and use that.  If the axis isn't a string or a
  Motion object, the scan will fail.  Also, the string must be the
  same case as in the IBEX block.

  >>> scan("Theta", start=0, stop=10, stride=2, frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=4.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=6.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=8.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=10.00 and two theta=0.00

  >>> scan("theta", start=0, stop=10, stride=2, frames=5)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
  RuntimeError: Unknown block theta.  Does the capitalisation match IBEX?

  >>> scan(True, start=0, stop=10, count=5) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
  Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
  TypeError: Cannot run scan on axis True. Try a string or a motion
  object instead.  It's also possible that you may need to rerun
  populate() to recreate your motion axes.

  The block needs to point at the underlying motor, e.g. `MOT:MTR0101`, 
  and not an axis PV.

Perform Fits
------------

  Performing a fit on a measurement is merely a modification of
  performing the plot

  >>> from general.scans.fit import *

  >>> fit = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, stride=0.6, fit=Linear, frames=5, save="linear.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> abs(fit["slope"] - 0.33) < 0.02
  True

  In this instance, the user requested a linear fit.  The result was an
  array with the slope and intercept.  The fit is also plotted over the
  original graph when finished.

  .. image:: linear.png

  >>> fit = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, stride=0.6, fit=PolyFit(3), frames=5, save="cubic.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> abs(fit["x^0"]) < 0.1
  True

  Higher order polynomials are also supported

  .. image:: cubic.png

  We can also plot the same scan against a Gaussian

  >>> fit = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, count=11, fit=Gaussian, frames=5, save="gaussian.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> abs(fit["center"] - 1.0) < 0.2
  True

  .. figure:: gaussian.png
     :alt: Fitting a gaussian

  There is a simple peak finder as well.  It finds the largest data
  point and then fits the local neighbourhood of points to a parabola
  to refine that point.  The width of that neighbourhood is the
  parameter to PeakFit.

  >>> fit = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, count=11, fit=PeakFit(0.7), frames=5, save="peak.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> abs(fit["peak"] - 1.0) < 0.1
  True

  .. figure:: peak.png
     :alt: Fitting a peak

  An alternative 'fitting' method is a "centre of mass" fit. For a set of
  data points (x, y) it calculates the centre of mass as sum(x*y)/sum(y).
  The background is subtracted before this calculation is done.

  >>> fit = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2, count=11, fit=CentreOfMass, frames=5, save="centre_of_mass.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.20 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.40 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.60 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.80 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=2.00 and two theta=0.00
  >>> 1.07 <= fit["Centre_of_mass"] <= 1.08
  True


Replaying Scans
---------------

It's fairly common to only realise that you should be fitting data
*after* starting a scan.  Thankfully,
:meth:`general.scans.scan.last_scan` allows you to replay the results
of the previous measurement and perform fits on it.

>>> from general.scans.scans import last_scan
>>> fit = last_scan().fit(Gaussian, save="replay.png")
>>> abs(fit["center"] - 1.0) < 0.2
True

  .. image:: replay.png
     :alt: A repeat of the previous scan with a fit added over the top

If you want to run an older scan, it's also possible to select the
saved results of a scan file and load it instead.

>>> fit = last_scan("mock_scan_02.dat").fit(Gaussian, save="replay2.png")
>>> abs(fit["center"] - 1.0) < 0.2
True


  .. image:: replay2.png
     :alt: A repeat of the of a much earlier scan

Perform complex scans
---------------------

  Some uses need more complicated measurements that just a simple scan
  over a single axis.  These more complicated commands may need some
  initial coaching from the beamline scientist, but should be simple
  enough for the user to modify them without assistance.

  >>> th= scan(theta, start=0, stop=1, stride=0.3)

  The above command does not contain a time command, so it does not
  run the full scan command.  Instead, it merely creates a scan
  object, which is then stored in the ``th`` variable.

  To start with, a user may want to scan theta and two theta together in
  lock step.

  >>> two_th= scan(two_theta, start=0, stop=2, stride=0.6)
  >>> (th& two_th).plot(frames=10, save="locked.png")
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.25 and two theta=0.50
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=1.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.75 and two theta=1.50
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=2.00

  .. figure:: locked.png
     :alt: Scan of th and two_th locked together

  On the other hand, if the user is unsure about the proper sample
  alignment, they may want to investigate theta and two-theta separately

  >>> th = scan(theta, start=0, stop=12, stride=0.5)
  >>> two_th = scan(two_theta, start=0, stop=2, stride=0.5)
  >>> (th * two_th).plot(frames=5, save="2d.png") # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=0.50
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=1.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=1.50
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=2.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=0.50
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=1.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=1.50
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=2.00
  ...
  Taking a count at theta=11.50 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=11.50 and two theta=0.50
  Taking a count at theta=11.50 and two theta=1.00
  Taking a count at theta=11.50 and two theta=1.50
  Taking a count at theta=11.50 and two theta=2.00
  Taking a count at theta=12.00 and two theta=0.00
  Taking a count at theta=12.00 and two theta=0.50
  Taking a count at theta=12.00 and two theta=1.00
  Taking a count at theta=12.00 and two theta=1.50
  Taking a count at theta=12.00 and two theta=2.00

  .. figure:: 2d.png
     :alt: 2D scan image

  Two scans can also be run one after the other.  If there are any
  overlapping points, then the measurement at that location will be
  performed twice and the results combined.  This can allow for
  iterative scanning to improve statistics.

  >>> two_theta(3.0)
  >>> th = scan(theta, start=0, stop=1, stride=0.5)
  >>> (th + th + th).plot(frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00

  A scan can also be run in the reverse direction, if desired.

  >>> th.reverse.plot(frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00

  To minimise motor movement, a scan can turn around at its end and
  run backwards to collect more statistics

  >>> th.and_back.plot(frames=5)
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=1.00 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.50 and two theta=3.00
  Taking a count at theta=0.00 and two theta=3.00

  For a more interactive experience, a scan be set to cycle forever,
  improving the statistics until the use manually kills the scan.

  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=1, stride=0.5).forever.fit(Gaussian, frames=5) #doctest: +SKIP


Perform continuous scans
------------------------

  The scans library has some ability to perform continuous scans. That
  is, the motor will keep moving at a set speed while data is being taken. This
  is implemented by polling the motor for it's position at a frequency (by
  default, 5Hz) while the move is in progress.

  Continuous scans currently have some limitations - for example, they can
  only be combined with each other, and not with other non-continuous scans.

  Instead of taking a set of points, a continuous scan takes a collection of
  `ContinuousMove` objects:

  >>> from general.scans.scans import ContinuousMove
  >>> ContinuousMove(start=-5, stop=5, speed=0.05)
  Continuous move from -5 to 5 at speed 0.05

  When using continuous scans, the detector function should ideally return
  quickly. For example, reading the value of a block is suitable, but beginning
  a run is unlikely to be suitable except for very slow scans.

  Continuous scans can be combined with each other (using python's `+` operator)
  and reversed using the `.and_back` property just like step scans. They can
  also be run forever using the `.forever` property. However, combinations of
  step and continuous scans are currently not implemented.


Estimate time
-------------

  It's not all that uncommon for users to find themselves setting an
  overnight run to perform while they sleep.  Since they are usually
  writing these scripts around two in the morning, their arithemtic
  skills frequently fail.  When the run terminates prematurely, the
  beam time is wasted.  When the user underestimates the time that
  they're requesting, they wake up to find that their measurements
  haven't finished and they must use more beam time to finish their
  results.

  Having the scan system perform estimates of the time required and
  the point of completion is a simple convenience to prevent these
  user headaches.

  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(frames=50)
  20.0
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(uamps=0.1)
  36.0
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(hours=1.0)
  14400.0
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(minutes=1.0)
  240.0
  >>> scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(seconds=5.0)
  20.0

  >>> needed = scan(theta, start=0, stop=2.0, step=0.6).calculate(frames=1000, time=True) #doctest: +SKIP
  The run would finish at 2017-07-17 20:06:24.600802
  >>> print(needed) #doctest: +SKIP
  400.0

SPEC compatibility
------------------

  As a convenience to users with an x-ray background, the `ascan` and
  dscan from SPEC have been implemented on top of the scanning
  interface.  The only major change is that negative times now
  represent a number of frames instead of a monitor count, since
  waiting for a monitor count is currently unsupported.

  >>> ascan(theta, 0, 2, 10, 1)

  Theta is at 2.5


Position Commands
-----------------

  The user needs to give three of the following keyword arguments to
  create a scan.

  :start: This is the initial position of the scan. Fnord
  :stop: This is the final position of the scan.  The type of step
	 chosen determines whether or not this final value is guaranteed
	 to be included in the final measurement.
  :before: This sets the initial position relative to the current position.
  :after: This sets the final position relative to the current position.
  :count: The total number of measurements to perform.  This parameter
	  always take precedence over "gaps"
  :gaps: The number steps to take.  The total number of measurements is
	 always one greater than the number of gaps.
  :stride: A *requested*, but not *mandatory*, step size.  Users often know
	   the range over which they wish to scan and their desired
	   scanning resolution.  ``stride`` measured the entire range, but
	   may increase the resolution to give equally spaced measurements.
	   ``stride`` always take precedence over ``step``
  :step: A mandatory step size.  If the request measurement range is not an

Class setup
-----------

  The base class for the low level code is the ``Scan`` class.  This
  ensures that any functionality added to this class or bugs fixed in
  its code propagate out to all callers of this library.  Unfortunately,
  Python does not have a concept of interfaces, so we cannot force all
  children to have a set of defined functions.  However, any subclasses
  of ``Scan`` must contain the follow member functions:

  :map: Create a modified version of the scan based on a user supplied
       function.  The original position of each point is fed as input to
       the function and the return value of the function is the new
       position.
  :reverse: Create a copy of the scan that runs in the opposite direction.
	    Reverse should be a property, since it takes no parameters
  :__len__: Return the number of elements in the scan
  :__iter__: Return an iterator that steps through the scan one position at
	    a time, yielding the current position at each point.

  There are four default subclasses of Scan that should handle most of
  the requirements

  SimpleScan
	     is the lowest level of the scan system.  It requires a
	     function which performs the desired action on each point, a
	     list of points, and a name for the axis.  At this time, all
	     scans are combinations of simpleScans.

  SumScan
     runs two scans sequentially.  These scans do not need to be on
     the same axes or even move the same number of axes.

  ProductScan
	     performs every possible combination of positions for two
	     different scans.  This provides an alternative to nested
	     loops.

  ParallelScan
	     takes to scans and runs their actions together at each
	     step.  For example, if ``a' was a scan over theta and `b``
	     was a scan over two theta, then ``a && b`` would scan each
	     theta angle with its corresponding two theta.

  The base ``Scan`` class contains four useful member functions.

  :plot: The ``plot`` function goes to each position listed in the scan,
	 takes a count, and plots it on an axis.  The user can specify the
	 counting command.
  :measure: The ``measure`` function goes to each position in the in the scan
	    and records a measurement.  The function is passed a title
	    which can include information about the current position in the
	    scan.
  :fit: Like ``plot``, this function takes a single count at each position.
	It then fits it to the user supplied model and returns the fitted
	value.  This could be anything from the peak position to the
	frequency of the curve.
  :calculate: This function takes a desired measurement time at each point
	      and, optionally, an approximated motor movement time.  It
	      returns an estimated duration for the scan and time of
	      completion.


Design Goals
------------

  This is a proposal for an improved system for running scans on the
  instrument.  The idea is to use ``Scan`` objects to represent the parts
  of the scan.  These scan objects form an algebra, making them easier
  to compose than using ``for`` loops.  These scan objects are mainly
  intended as tools for the instrument scientists for creating a higher
  level interface that the users will interact with.

  We desire the following traits in the Scanning system


User simplicity
===============

  The users need to be able to perform simple scans without thinking
  about object orient programming or algebraic data types.  Performing a
  basic scan should always be a one liner.  Making modified versions of
  that scan should require learning a modification of that command and
  not an entirely new structure.  Common, sensible user options should
  be available and sane defaults given.

  The code should also take advantage of Python's built in documentation
  system to allow for discoverability of all of the functionality of
  these scripts.


Composability
=============

  The code should trivially allow combining smaller scripts into a
  larger script.  This ensures that, as long as the smaller scripts are
  bug free, the larger scripts will also be free of bugs by
  construction.


Functionality
=============

  The code should be able to perform all of the tasks that might involve
  scanning on the beamline, from the common place to the irregular.

  Plotting: It should be possible to plot any readback value as a function
	    of any set of motor positions.  Scans of multiple axes should
	    be able to either plot multiple labelled lines or a 2D heatmap
  Measuring: Performing a full series of measurements should only be a
	     minor modification of the plotting command
  Fitting: The user should be capable of performing fits on curves to
	   extract values of interest.  Common fitting routines should be
	   a simple string while still accepting custom functions for
	   exceptional circumstances
  Spacing: It should be possible to space points both linearly and
	   logarithmically.
  Prediction: It should be possible to estimate the time needed for a scan
	      before the scan is performed.
