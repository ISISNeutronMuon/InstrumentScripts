	* general/scans/motion.py (BlockMotion.__init__): BlockMotion will
	now find the block in ANY case if the block isn't present in the
	chosen case.  This also gives case insensitivity the scan
	function when the axis is passed as a string.

	SANS module.  These proposals were accepted and added over a year
	ago.

	SANS documentation.

	* general/scans/motion.py (populate): Fix bug with populate not
	accept blocks with unicode names.

	* test.sh (PYTHON_VERSION): Only generate documentation under
	python 3.  The new dependency graph generators only work under
	Python 3 due to the use of the singledispatch decorator to help
	navigate the abstract syntax tree of the python source.  With
	Python 2 receiving it's end of life in less than three months, I'm
	not to concerned about this decision.

	* technique/sans/util.py: Remove lint

	* .travis.yml (before_script): Install graphviz on the CI server
	for graphs in the documentation.

	* .pylintrc (ignore-imports): Ignore duplicate imports across
	modules.  Many instrument modules will wind up needing to import
	the same functions, so the duplication is to be expected.  This
	could be bypassed by making the imports more implicit, but that
	would make the code less readable.

	* .gitignore: Ignore dotfiles produced as byproduct of documentation generation
