Shared Instrument Scripts repository.

# Documentation

For documentation see the [wiki](https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/InstrumentScripts/wiki).

There is also documentation for the [individual modules](https://instrumentscripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

There is a temporary [continuous integration setup](https://travis-ci.org/rprospero/InstrumentScripts), but this should eventually be replaced by something with a shared ownership.

# Setup

Run the `setup.bat` script in the top level of this repository.
